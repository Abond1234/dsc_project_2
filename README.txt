Karamoja Food Security Monitoring System
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an interactive data visualization tool for monitoring food security in the Karamoja region of Uganda. The focus is on visualizing crop yields, population data, and the comparison between maize and sorghum yields across various districts and sub-counties in Karamoja. The final output includes a series of visualizations created using Tableau, which can help stakeholders understand and address food security challenges in the region.

Datasets
The following datasets were used in this project:

Tabular Datasets:

district_cyp.csv: Contains district-level crop yield and population data for Karamoja.
subcounty_cyp.csv: Contains sub-county-level crop yield and population data for Karamoja.
merged_cyp.csv: A merged dataset combining both district and sub-county data for analysis.
Spatial Data:

maize_map.shp: A shapefile representing areas where maize is grown.
sorg_map.shp: A shapefile representing areas where sorghum is grown.
ug_dist.shp: A shapefile representing the district boundaries of Uganda.
subc_ug.shp: A shapefile representing the sub-county boundaries of Uganda.
Visualizations Created
The following visualizations were developed to provide insights into the food security situation in Karamoja:

Population by District (Map): A map visualization showing the population distribution across different districts in Karamoja.

Population by Subcounty: A bar chart showing the population across various sub-counties in Karamoja.

Comparison between Maize and Sorghum Yield per District: A bar chart comparing the yield of maize and sorghum across different districts.

Comparison between Maize and Sorghum Area per District: A bar chart comparing the area under maize and sorghum cultivation in various districts.

Maize Yields per District: A focused analysis of maize yields across districts.

Project Structure
Data Preparation: Data cleaning and merging were conducted in Python using Pandas. The cleaned datasets were exported as CSV files for use in Tableau.
Visualization: The visualizations were created using Tableau, utilizing various fields and spatial data to provide insights.
Analysis: The analysis focused on identifying key patterns in crop yields and population distribution to support decision-making for food security.
How to Use
Data Preparation:

Ensure you have Python installed along with Pandas and any other necessary libraries.
Run the provided Python scripts to clean and merge the data.
Visualization:

Open Tableau and import the cleaned datasets.
Utilize the visualizations to explore the data and generate insights.
Conclusion and Recommendations
This project provided valuable insights into the population distribution and crop yields in the Karamoja region. Key recommendations include:

Focus on improving maize yield, particularly in districts where it lags behind sorghum.
Allocate resources efficiently based on population distribution to address food security challenges.
Use this visualization tool as a baseline for further analysis and decision-making to improve agricultural productivity and food security in the region.
